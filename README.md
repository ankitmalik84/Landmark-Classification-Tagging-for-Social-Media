# Landmark Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks 🗺️🏛️

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, we build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images and create a model to predict the most likely locations where the image was taken. The final app will suggest the top 5 most relevant landmarks from 50 possible landmarks from across the world.

## Project Overview 🌍

Photo sharing and storage services often lack location metadata for uploaded images. This project addresses the challenge by detecting and classifying landmarks in the images using a CNN-powered app.

### Key Objectives 🎯

✔️ Build a CNN from scratch for landmark classification.  
✔️ Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies.  
✔️ Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models.  
✔️ Develop a simple app to predict landmarks from user-uploaded images.

## Data Preprocessing 🧹

### Procedure

1. **Resize Images:**

   - First resize images to 256x256 pixels.
   - Then crop images to 224x224 pixels.
   - Chosen 224x224 as it is the recommended input size for using PyTorch's pre-trained models.

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Applied `RandAugment` to augment the dataset with translations, flips, and rotations.
   - Aimed to improve model robustness and test accuracy.

## 🏗️ CNN Architecture (From Scratch)

### Steps to Final Architecture

1. **Initial Setup:**

   - 7 convolutional blocks to ensure expressiveness.
   - Dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
   - Output a 50-dimensional vector to match the 50 landmark classes.

2. **Training Parameters:**
   - Batch size: 64
   - Validation size: 20%
   - Epochs: 50
   - Learning rate: 0.01
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Weight decay: \(1 \times 10^{-8}\)

### Results

- **Test Loss:** 1.632997
- **Test Accuracy:** 60% (760/1250)

## 🤖 Transfer Learning

### Procedure

1. **Model Choice:**

   - Used `ResNet152` for transfer learning due to its performance on ImageNet and suitability for natural scene images.

2. **Training Parameters:**
   - Batch size: 64
   - Validation size: 20%
   - Epochs: 50
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Weight decay: 0.0

### Results

- **Test Loss:** 0.807198
- **Test Accuracy:** 79% (998/1250)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.block(x)

    def __init__(self, num_classes: int, dropout: float):
        super().__init__()
        channels = [3,] + [2**(4+i) for i in range(7)]
        self.model = nn.Sequential()
        for i in range(7):
            self.model.add_module(f"ConvBlock_{i}", ConvBlock(channels[i], channels[i+1]))
        self.model.add_module("Head", Head(channels[-1], channels[-2], num_classes, dropout))
